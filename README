This is a project for collecting many useful small sefl-containing programs.

Each of this programs should demonstrate some specific non-intuitive 
implementation using enlightenment libraries, like:
* swallowing to an edje canvas
* scrollable list
* scrollable list, where each line is a smart object, allowing 
  more nice feature to be implemented, like horizontal swiping, etc.
